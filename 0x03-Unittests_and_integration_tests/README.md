# Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on unit testing and integration testing for back-end systems. The project aims to help me understand and implement effective testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, and to ensure that the codebase is reliable and maintains high quality.

## Testing Goals

## Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual functions to ensure they return expected results for various inputs. The primary focus is to test the function's logic while mocking any calls to external functions or services (e.g., network or database calls).

## Integration Testing

Integration testing is aimed at testing code paths end-to-end. In these tests, only low-level functions that interact with external systems (such as HTTP requests, file I/O, or database I/O) are typically mocked.
